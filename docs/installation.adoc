== Installation Instructions ==

=== Before You Run ===

1. Please make sure you have all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (located in root directory) installed.

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. Make sure you fill the configuration files. They contain the necessary _settings_, _preferences_ and the important information required for the functioning of the app. There are two configuration files

  - `config.py` : This is a general config file containing variables required for functioning of the application.
  - `instance/config.py` : This is a secret config file, meaning the config variables in this file contain sensitive information and should not reach git or be exposed.

You'll find description of each variable in the config file itself. Feel free to open an issue in case more information is needed.
